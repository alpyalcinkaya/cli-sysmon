## Sysmon 
A lightweight system health and update monitor built for CachyOS (and other Arch-based distributions).

## Why?
This project was born out of curiosity to explore the intersection of System Administration and Software Engineering. While many monitoring tools exist, this was built for the purposes of practice with:
1) Modular Architecture
2) Python Packaging
3) Terminal UIs (TUI)

## Features
**Live Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of Disk and Memory usage.
**Update Tracking**: Safe checking of pending `pacman` updates using the `checkupdates` utility.
**Robust CLI**: A globally accessible command-line interface installed via Python entry points.
